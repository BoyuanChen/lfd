lfd: Learning from Demonstrations for Robotic Manipulation
==========================================================

*lfd* is a software framework for generalizing robot trajectories from demonstrations into new situations, thus enabling robots to learn to perform tasks from demonstrations.

This software follows the line of work of these papers: [ISRR2013]_, [IROS2013]_, [IROS2014]_.

Source code is available on `github <https://github.com/rll/lfd>`_.
